abstract: "Identification of outages in power systems is crucial to raise situational awareness and prevent cascading failures. As a result of the wide adoption of phasor measurement units (PMUs), synchronized measurements with high temporal resolution provide new opportunities for event detection and identification in electric power systems. A framework for multiple model-based outage identification algorithms is proposed, which can be implemented in a complementary fashion in utility control center."
