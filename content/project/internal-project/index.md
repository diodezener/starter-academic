Performed power flow studies and transient stability analysis for benchmark systems and the Ontario power system using different simulation tools (e.g., MATPOWER, PSCAD and PSS/E)
Developed novel line outage and generator outage identification algorithms based on various types of PMU measurements, which improved localization accuracy.
The proposed methods are fast and can be implemented in parallel in utility control centers.
